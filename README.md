# NLP-SEM-6-PROJECT
## NLP SEM 2024-2025 MINI PROJECT ON Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis
### Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis
### Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
### Project Overview:

This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project focuses on News Classification, where we apply various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models to categorize news articles into predefined categories. This project involves exploring techniques like text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluating the models for their effectiveness in classifying news articles.

### Project Title:
### Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis
### Project Abstract:
Customer reviews play a crucial role in understanding consumer satisfaction and improving business operations. This dataset consists of 1,050 customer reviews, each classified into one of three key categories: Quality, Shipping, and Service. The dataset aims to help businesses quickly identify recurring themes in customer feedback, enabling them to pinpoint areas for improvement. Each entry includes a unique review ID, the review text, and its corresponding category, making it useful for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, sentiment analysis, and machine learning-based text classification. This dataset can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, businesses, and developers working on customer experience analysis and automation.

### Algorithms Used:
### Machine Learning Algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

### Deep Learning Algorithms:


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

### Language Models:

GPT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

### Comparative Analysis:
The comparative analysis of different models highlights their effectiveness in classifying news articles into the correct category. The following table summarizes the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models tested:

### Conclusion:
This Automated Customer Review Classification for Enhanced Feedback Analysis project demonstrates the potential of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Language Models for text classification tasks, particularly for categorizing news articles. The comparative analysis reveals that BERT, a transformer-based model, outperforms traditional methods and deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. By employing various algorithms, we gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, allowing us to choose the most suitable approach for news classification.
