1,"The delivery service was quite efficient, but I did encounter a small delay. Initially, I was given a delivery estimate of three days, but it took five days instead. The tracking system worked fine, but the updates were not as frequent as I would have liked. The package arrived in good condition, so that was a relief. If they can work on timeliness, it would be perfect.",Shipping
